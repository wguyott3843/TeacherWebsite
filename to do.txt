1. ask professor boughosn how to put the selected class into session state using javascript? 

in manageClass.php line 57 in the onchange event im passing the classId as part of the url. 

is there a way to set ClassId in the session state using javascript so that i can access it from the $_session array
from php when i move to the next page.

2. implement manageHomework.php page like manageClass.php page getting the ClassId from session state.

Uses classHomeworks.php

3. implement manageClassAnnouncement.php page like manageClass.php page getting the ClassId from session state.

Uses classAnouncements.php

2. implement profile page, announcement page, students page just like classes page.

3. implement student profile and student classes.

need to figure out how to do read only pages. 

4. implement add delete and update functionality.

need to figure out how to pass the class information from the manage class page to each of these pages.
have to pass ClassNumber ClassName ClassDescription and ClassId, ideally we will do this in session state.
