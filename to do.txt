-----

1. clean up welcome teacher and welcome student pages.

2. implement profile page, announcement page, students page just like classes page.

3. implement student profile and student classes.

4. student and teacher profile need back buttons.

5. update the logout.php page to display an error if one is set in session state. change our error calls to logout.php to set an error message in session.

6. add a due date to the homework table.  Update studentHomework.php to display the due date.  Also update the teacherHomework.php page with due date.
   In the meantime the teacher can include the due date in the text associated with the homework.  Also add names to the homework table.

7. When i add the due date to the homework table, also add a long description.

8. things to document: 

	if there are two logins from the same browser instance they end up sharing session state. This probably could be fixed by assigning names to each session when we create them.  This needs further investigation.

	Need to figure out some way for teachers to add students to classes.  Not going to have time to do that for this project.  

	Deleteing a student and then trying to add a new student with the same first and last name will fail becasue the original student record 
	is still in the database with a non null delete date.  So the uniqueness constraint will prevent adding a new record even though the old one is no longer valid.
